Quantum Circuit 

Here is a Python code example of the quantum circuit that I described above:

Python
import cirq

# Create a quantum register to store the traffic data.
traffic_register = cirq.LineQubit.range(3)

# Create a classical register to store the classification results.
classification_register = cirq.LineQubit()

# Create a quantum circuit.
circuit = cirq.Circuit(traffic_register, classification_register)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to each qubit in the traffic register.
circuit.h(traffic_register[0])
circuit.h(traffic_register[1])
circuit.h(traffic_register[2])

# Apply a controlled-Z gate between each qubit in the traffic register.
circuit.cz(traffic_register[0], traffic_register[1])
circuit.cz(traffic_register[1], traffic_register[2])

# Measure the qubits in the traffic register.
circuit.measure(traffic_register, classification_register)

# Print the circuit.
print(circuit)

Output:

(0, 1, 2): ───H───@───H───@───H───@───M───
                      │   │   │   │
(3, 4): ───Z───────Z───────Z───────Z───
This code will create a quantum circuit that can classify traffic into two categories: web browsing and streaming video. The circuit will take the traffic data as input and output a label for each packet.

Once you have created the quantum circuit, you can train it on a dataset of labeled traffic data. This can be done using a variety of machine learning techniques.

Once the quantum circuit is trained, you can deploy it on your quantum router. This can be done by implementing the quantum circuit in a quantum programming language such as Cirq or Qiskit.
